I'm new to this whole coding thing.

Hello everyone!

BlueLineRookie here,

I have always been interested in learning to code. I am big into behind the scenes stuff and coding is behind the scenes to basically everything in today's world. Here's to hoping my wife doesn't divorce me if/when she finds out I'm doing this.
